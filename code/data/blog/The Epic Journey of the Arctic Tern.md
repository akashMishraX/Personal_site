## Meet the Arctic Tern

The **Arctic Tern** (*Sterna paradisaea*) is a small, elegant seabird with a sleek body, forked tail, and striking black cap. While it may appear delicate, this bird is built for endurance. It weighs just about 100 grams (3.5 ounces) but has a wingspan of approximately 75-85 cm (30-33 inches), enabling it to glide effortlessly across vast distances.

## A Journey Like No Other

The Arctic Tern holds the title for the **longest migration of any animal on Earth**. Each year, it travels from its breeding grounds in the Arctic to its wintering grounds in the Antarctic and back again—a staggering round trip of nearly **71,000 kilometers (44,000 miles)**!

### **The Route**
- **Summer in the Arctic**: The Arctic Tern begins its journey in the northern hemisphere's summer, nesting in the Arctic tundra where food is plentiful and conditions are optimal for raising chicks.
- **The Southward Migration**: As winter approaches, the bird heads south, often flying along coastlines and ocean currents. Along the way, it stops to feed on fish and other marine creatures.
- **Winter in the Antarctic**: The Terns arrive in the Antarctic during its summer season, where the sunlight and food supply are abundant.
- **The Return**: After several months in the Antarctic, they begin their northward journey back to the Arctic, completing their incredible round trip.

## How Do They Do It?

### **Adaptations for the Journey**
1. **Efficient Flight**: The Arctic Tern’s aerodynamic body and long wings allow it to glide for hours, conserving energy.
2. **Navigation Skills**: Scientists believe the Terns use a combination of the Earth’s magnetic field, celestial cues, and visual landmarks to navigate.
3. **Fuel Stops**: Along their migration, the Terns feed on small fish and invertebrates to refuel for their journey.

### **Energy and Endurance**
The Arctic Tern’s migration is not just about distance—it’s about survival. By following the sun and migrating between polar regions, the bird experiences more daylight annually than any other creature, maximizing its access to food and warmth.
