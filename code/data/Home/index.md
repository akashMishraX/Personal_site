# Welcome
Hey there! I’m a **backend developer** who loves turning complex problems into elegant solutions. My GitHub is like my digital playground, where I tinker with **JavaScript**, **Python** to build scalable, high-performance applications.
<br>
When I’m not crafting APIs or optimizing databases, you’ll probably find me experimenting with new tech, sipping coffee, or diving into a good sci-fi novel.
